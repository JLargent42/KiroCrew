"""check_connector_manifest.py — validate connector-campaign manifest entries.

Enforces the field-level schema in
``docs/system-specs/modules/connector-capability-manifest.md`` against every
manifest entry, ``ConformanceRun``, and ``EvidenceReceipt`` record actually
committed to this repository. This is the W00-S2 validator: the spec itself
ships no runnable checker (deliberately — see that document's "What this
spec deliberately does not contain"), so this script is the first thing that
turns the spec's prose rules into a pass/fail gate a CI job can run.

## What this checks, structurally, per the spec

- Every manifest entry (one JSON file per operation, see the spec's
  "Resolved this round (W00-S2)" artifact-format paragraph) has the full
  required field set, correct types, and every required-when relationship
  the spec states (``pagination`` required iff ``operation_kind`` is
  ``list``/``search``; ``retry`` required iff ``effect`` is write-shaped;
  ``verification_contract`` non-null from ``code_complete`` on; the per-rung
  checklist; the three-way ``verification_contract`` <-> ``ConformanceRun``
  <-> ``EvidenceReceipt`` equality; the ``evidence_by_mode_surface_and_auth``
  totality rule once ``status`` leaves ``planned``; the per-cell four-
  coordinate equality against the run it cites).
- Every ``source.snapshot_ref`` resolves per the spec's now-fixed contract:
  an ``https://`` URL for ``official_docs``/``format_spec``, or an in-repo
  path that actually exists on disk for ``repo_path`` /
  ``search_snippet_corroborated`` / ``user_stated`` / ``not_yet_sourced``
  (except the ``not_yet_sourced`` placeholder itself, which is exempt by
  design — see the spec's own carve-out).
- Cross-file consistency: every ``ConformanceRun``/``EvidenceReceipt``
  reference a manifest entry makes actually resolves to a record that
  exists, and the referenced record's own back-pointers agree (the
  three-way equality above), never assumed from field presence alone.
- Denominator/count invariants the campaign's evidence catalog states
  (``services[].operations[]`` + ``gaps[].demoted_operations_full_record[]``
  + the one contract-attachment operation == 273; the 72 ``contract_id``
  total) are NOT cross-checked by this validator against
  ``catalog-evidence.json`` or ``contract-and-dag.md`` — this gate validates
  manifest *entries* against the manifest *schema*; the campaign evidence
  catalog's own counts are that catalog's own responsibility to keep
  internally consistent (see the spec's "What 'the required range' means"),
  and duplicating that cross-check here would create a second place those
  invariants could drift out of sync with the catalog's own reconciliation
  math. A future round that wants this specific cross-check built is a
  separate, explicitly-scoped addition, not an implicit consequence of
  mirroring the catalog's files into this repo.

## What this deliberately does not check

- Liveness of an ``https://`` `snapshot_ref` (no network call — this is a
  static validator; see the spec's own "does not contain" list).
- Whether a `ConformanceRun`'s `verdict: pass` is actually TRUE (that is the
  conformance runner's job, a separate, not-yet-built round; this validator
  only checks that the schema's structural relationships hold given
  whatever verdict is recorded).
- Anything about the runner or discovery protocol's *implementation* — only
  the manifest-entry / `ConformanceRun` / `EvidenceReceipt` *schema*.
