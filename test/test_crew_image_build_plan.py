"""The crew image lane must cover the recipe CLASS, not two named recipes.

``backend-test-crew-container`` imports the crew image's Python modules and runs
them on the host. It never builds the image, so a recipe naming a producer script
that is not in the tree is green in CI: the image cannot be built from a clean
checkout, and no gate says so.

``crew-image-build.yml`` runs the build for real. These tests hold the part of
that lane which a build cannot check about itself:

* the derivation is right, and every refusal fires -- so "the lane could not
  classify a recipe" can never quietly become "the lane skipped a recipe";
* every recipe in the real tree has a derivable role, checked statically on
  every pull request with no Docker;
* the digest the probe bundle is stamped with equals the one the IMAGE computes,
  so the two cannot drift apart into a lane that builds only bundles the
  container would refuse;
* every producer the recipes cite is inside the workflow's ``paths`` filter, so
  editing a producer fires the lane that runs it.
