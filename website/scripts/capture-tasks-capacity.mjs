/**
 * Screenshot harness for the System > Services "Tasks & capacity" card.
 *
 * Runs the REAL built SPA (website/dist) behind the shared static server with
 * every /api/** call answered by the shared boot stub — no gateway, no token.
 * Only `/api/tasks/summary` is scene-specific: one empty payload and one
 * populated payload shaped like `dashboard/handlers/tasks.py` emits, with a
 * row in every wait state the card distinguishes so the two shots prove the
 * copy the UX lane judged: the cap line vs the running line, the link on a
 * row blocked on the user, and "Retrying now" vs "Waiting to retry".
 *
 * Both shots are the card element alone, at 1x, so they stay small and match
 * the earlier evidence frames at the same paths.
 *
 * Usage: node scripts/capture-tasks-capacity.mjs [outDir]
